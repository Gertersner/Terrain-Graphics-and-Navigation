When you press "y" the restrictions are removed and you can move above the height limit
Some peaks go past the height limit and thus we can not navigate to the top of some peaks.
While being higher than the height limit and you press "y" again, then you will be unable to move unless you press "y" again to remove the restrictions.
If you turn off the restrictions and navigate outside the terrain, and then press "y" again then you will also be locked in place similar to going past the height limit
Navigating beneath the terrain while having the restrictions off and the turing the restrictions back on will warp you to the terrain and you will be able to move.
